# Advent of Code 2023 | Haskell

Here are my solutions for the 2023 edition of [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023/about).

This year, I'll be trying out [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/).  
My experience with OCaml last year was pleasant, but I did struggle a bit with the thin standard library. I also am a bit conflicted on the way it had me deal with mutability for data structures (esp. maps and sets). Hence the decision to handle this year's problems in a purer functional language.
